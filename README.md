# Best Practices for Software Development on GitHub

Okay, so first off: [**you should read the GitHub Guides**](https://guides.github.com/). These cover the most important things about using GitHub, and, honestly, the ultimate scope of this README is just to cover like an additional five to ten percent that's weird and opinionated and not covered in those guides (like the naming scheme you should use for repositories, or how you should structure GitHub Pages).

See [the issues on this repo](https://github.com/stuartpb/github-best-practices/issues) for topics that aren't yet covered.
