# Best Practices for Software Development on GitHub

## TODO

Describe:

- when a project should be set up with its own organization.
- how repositories under an organization should be set up (ie. one for website, one for logo/branding...).
- how GitHub Pages should be architected.
- how repositories should be named (ie. generally lower-case and hyphenated, [not treating the org name as a prefix](https://github.com/stuartpb/stuartpb.plan/commit/5d844af92395333b4eb2beb02900ac5c5083fd5d)).
- using issues to track features, etc.
- Cross-referencing issues whenever possible.
